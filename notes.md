# Compile-time Validation

### Summary

- the DRY principle
- make bad things hard
- let the compiler do the work

---

### In Practice

- write pure functions
- use types to provide context
- use mathematical abstractions
- aim for functional architecture

---


Together they are:

- **functional programming**
- **type-driven development**

---


### What is Simplicity

Slightly increasing the complexity of the building blocks  
dramatically improves what can be built.

---

- pits of failure vs pits of success
- quality cannot be "tested into" SW

---


### Leadership

- incremental change does not work
- solution requires leadership and technology
- this is a human problem, not a technology problem

---

- we need fundamental change
- we need computer scientists
