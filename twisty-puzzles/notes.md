Rubik's Cubes and Twisty Puzzle Theory

Rubik's cubes

History

the 80s

Explosion of mass appeal because of YouTube

The lingo

Notation:
https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/
Gives a small name to each of the ways to rotate the cube

Algorithm:
A sequence of rotations to permute your cube from one shape to another

Example algorithm:

R U R' U R U2 R'

Solving the 3x3:

DONT

(if you take it apart and put it back, there's a 1 in 12 chance it's solvable, but if you give it to someone who speedsolves -- they'll notice exactly what they have to change before they finish solving)

(don't take the stickers off and put them back on randomly, you about 1 in 2.3 hexillion chance that it's solvable)

DO

Essentially all methods are partitioned into two phases
1. Intuition
2. Memorization

Jessica Fridich popularized the notion of solving the cube layer by layer.

Fridrich method
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_Method

The very beginner methods:
1. Cross - intuition
2. First layer - memorization
3. Second layer - memorization
4. 2-look OLL - memorization
5. 2-look PLL - memorization

Badmephisto's rubik's cube tutorial (of friedrich method)

1. Cross - intuition
1. F2L - intuition
2. 2-look OLL - memorization
3. 2-look PLL - memorization

As you get better, and memorize more

One-look OLL (57 algorithms)
One-look PLL (21 algorithms)

There are also other variants on the last layer

Petrus method
https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Petrus_Method

1. 2x2x2 - intuition
2. 2x2x3
3. 2x3x3 (only Rs and Us, very fast)
4. OLL
5. PLL

ZZ method
https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZ_method

1. EO+line - intuition
2. F2L - intuition (no F or B moves ever!)
3. LL (OLL/PLL, COLL/EPLL 42+4, one-shot)

Number of permutations on a 3x3x3

~43 quintiliion

Number of permutations on a 7x7x7

"For a 7x7x7 Cube this number is about 1.95 * 10160 roughly 19.5 duoquinquagintillion."

If you like Math:

Rubik's cubes form a permutation group:
* The identity operation: no rotation
* Every operation has an inverse: i.e. F <=> F'
* Rotations are associative: (R U) F <=> R (U F)

God's number:

The smallest number of moves to solve the cube from any position is 20 (calculated with 36-CPU years of compute in 2010)
